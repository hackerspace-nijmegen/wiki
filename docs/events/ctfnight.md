# CTF night

Capture-the-flag and wargames are online challenges to learn pen-testing step-by-step. There are tons of challenge websites out there to choose from in a range of difficulty levels (even for complete novices) and on a wide variety of topics, ranging from javascript vulnerabilities to stack-overflow exploits.

These games are particularly fun when played as a "race" against other people in the same room.
